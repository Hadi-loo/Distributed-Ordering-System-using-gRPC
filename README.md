# Distributed Ordering System using gRPC

This Go-based gRPC project aims to facilitate efficient communication between clients and servers through four distinct methods: unary, server-streaming, client-streaming, and bidirectional streaming for fetching order data. Leveraging the gRPC framework, it enables seamless communication between distributed systems, allowing for real-time data retrieval and processing. Through these different paradigms, the project showcases the versatility and scalability of gRPC in modern software development.
